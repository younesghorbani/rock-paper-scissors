# rock-paper-scissors

This project is a simple version of the lovely "Rock Paper Scissors" game. 
In this version of the game, there are two players, 
one of which is the computer. The game is played in infinite rounds. 
In each round, the computer randomly chooses one of the "Rock", 
"Paper" and "Scissors" options, and the other player must enter one of the 
three options too. In each round, being winner or loser of each player 
is displayed, as well as each player's current score. The game continues 
until one of the two players reaches five points first. Then the game 
ends and the final result (being winner or loser) is displayed 
along with the score of both players.
