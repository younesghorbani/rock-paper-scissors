# rock-paper-scissors

This project is a simple version of the lovely "Rock Paper Scissors" game. 
In this version of the game, there are two players, 
one of which is the computer. The game is played in five rounds. 
In each round, the computer randomly chooses one of the "Rock", 
"Paper" and "Scissors" options, and the other player must enter one of the 
three options too. In each round, one of the two players wins or loses. 
At the end of the fifth round, whichever player has the most points wins the game 
and if the scores of both players are equal, the game will not have a winner.
